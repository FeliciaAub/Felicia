<summary>A few things about me...</summary>
<h2>&#10003; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've earned a bachelor's in computer science at California State
   University of Fullerton and have been a coding instructor for kids for several years.
   I believe programming and computer science are important skills to teach younger generations so they can develop
   critical thinking and problem solving skills to become the innovators of tomorrow.
  The more hands in the pot we have now will determine the creativity and robustness of technology in the future.
  </h2>
<h2>&#10003; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an aspiring data scientist, I spend much of my free time organizing information to provide context both arbitrarily and visually. You can find a few projects
<a id="aboutme" href="data.html">here</a>    </h2>
 <h2>
    &#10003; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The impact of new and emerging technology will have on society is of great concern and interest to me. I've written about the role automation plays in labor displacement specifically autonomous vehicles and truck drivers. Paper included
    <a id="aboutme" href="img/auto.pdf#paper">here</a>.
</h2>
<h2>
  &#10003;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I've also conducted several academic lectures on biased algorithms. How do we prevent perpetuating bias in algorithms without tampering with the usefulness of the data collected?
